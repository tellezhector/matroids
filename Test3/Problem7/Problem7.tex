    (Lehman 1964) Let $e$ be an element of a connected binary matroid $M$ and let $\mathcal{C}_e$ be the set of circuits
    containing $e$. Show that the circuits of $M$ not containing $e$ are precisely the minimal non-empty sets of the
    form $C_1 \triangle C_2$ where $C_1, C_2 \in \mathcal{C}_e$.
