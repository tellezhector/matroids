    (Whitney 1932a; Ore 1967, Section 3.3) The graph $H$ is a Whitney dual of the graph $G$ if there is a bijection 
    $\psi : E(E) \rightarrow E(H)$ such that, for all subsets $Y \subset E(G)$,
    \begin{align}
            r(M(H)) - r(M(H)\setminus \psi(Y)) = |Y| - r(M(G)|Y).
    \end{align}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Show that if $H$ is a Whitney dual of G, then G is a Whitney dual of $H$.
        \item Determine the relationship between Whitney duals and geometric and abstract duals.
        \item Prove that a graph is planar if and only if it has a Whitney dual.
    \end{enumerate}
