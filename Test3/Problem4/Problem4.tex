    Let $G$ be a connected plane graph.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Use matroid duality to show that $G$ satisfies Euler's polyhedron formula,
                \begin{align}
                        |V(G)| - |E(G)| + |F(G)| = 2,
                \end{align}
                where $F(G)$ is the set of faces of $G$.
        \item Prove that if $G$ is simple and $|V(G)| \geq 3$ then
                \begin{align}
                    |E(G)| \leq 3|V(G)| - 6.
                \end{align}
                
        \item Characterize the graphs for which equality is attained in (ii).
        
        \item Show that if $G$ is simple, then it has a vertex of degree at most five.
        
        \item Given an example of a simple plane graph in which every vertex has degree five.
    \end{enumerate}
}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item
            We know that $|E(G)| = |E(G')|$, $|V(G)| = |F(G')|$, $|F(G)| = |V(G')|$
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{proof}
