\chapter*{Note for the readers:}
    The goal on writing this in english instead of writing it in my first language (spanish) is because 
    this way I can start building a portfolio that could not be as important as a research project, but
    it is work after all. So it would be better to have something to show that nothing to show at all, 
    and much better if the audience capable of read it is as wide as possible.\pn
    
    As my first language is not english, this text could have a lot of mispellings and
    bad use of english. I apologize in advance and I'll try to be as careful as possible.\pn
    
    Here is a link to this project's version controller repository:\par
    \href{https://github.com/tellezhector/matroids}{https://github.com/tellezhector/matroids}\par
    There you can see what are the changes that have ocurred along all this project's lifetime.\pn
    
    If you want to leave comments you can do it there, where anyone else is able to notice it. Or you could 
    write directly to my personal e-mail address, which is: \texttt{tellez.hector@gmail.com} where it will be read only
    by me.
