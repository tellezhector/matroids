\begin{proof}$\,$\pn
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item 
            Let $U_{n,m}$ be an uniform matroid.\pn
            
            Lets asume that it is self-dual. As
            any basis $B$ for $U_{n,m}$ has size $n$, if it is going to be self-dual,
            then its complement must have size $n$ as well. This means that $m = 2n$.\pn
            
            Now lets suppose that $m = 2n$. So, any subset of size $n$ is a basis for $U_{n,m}$,
            but it is also true that any subset of size $n$ is the complement of another subset
            of size $n$ and then, any basis is the complement of another basis. Then $U_{n,m}$ is
            not only self-dual, but also identically self-dual.
        \item 
            Just as we saw above, if an uniform matroid is self-dual, then it is identically self-dual, and
            an uniform matroid $U_{n,m}$ is self-dual if and only if $m = 2n$.
        \item 
            Lets asume that the graphs are connected. For not connected graphs the following conditions
            must hold for each of the connected compontents.\pn
            
            Any graph with no edges.\pn
            
            A graph with two vertices and two parallel edges.\pn
            
            Any graph with three vertices and four edges that such that any edge has at most
            a parallel one.\pn
            MISSING!
            
        \item 
            Any graph on six or fewer elements obtained from a forest adding a parallel edge to each edge in the forest.
            MISSING!
            
        \item 
            Any wheel.
    \end{enumerate}
