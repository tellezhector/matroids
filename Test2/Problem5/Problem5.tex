    Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over a field $F$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item For each of the row operations, specify an $m \times m$ matrix $L$ such that
              multiplying $A$ on the left by $L$ has the same effect as the row operation.\pn
        \item Fore each of the column operations, specify an $n \times n$ matrix $R$ such that multiplying $A$ on the right
                by $R$ has the same effect as the column operation.
    \end{enumerate}
}
\begin{proof}$,$\pn
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item         
            Take the $m \times m$ identity matrix. Perform any of the row operations to it and let $L$
            be the result.\pn
        
            Such matrix is called elemental matrix,  and if you multiply $A$ on the left by $L$ it will have the
            same effect as the row operation.
            
        \item
            The proof is exaclty the same, but working with columns. Perform any of the column operations to the
            $n \times n$ identity matrix, and let $R$ be the result.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
