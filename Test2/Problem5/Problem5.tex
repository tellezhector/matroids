    Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over a field $F$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item For each of the row operations, specify an $m \times m$ matrix $L$ such that
              multiplying $A$ on the left by $L$ has the same effect as the row operation.\pn
        \item Fore each of the column operations, specify an $n \times n$ matrix $R$ such that multiplying $A$ on the right
                by $R$ has the same effect as the column operation.
    \end{enumerate}
