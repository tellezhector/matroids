	Consider the wheel graph $W_r$. Show that if $r \geq 3$, then $M(W_r)$ has
	$M(K_4)$ as a minor.
}
\begin{proof}
    Thinking of graphs, we can obtain $K_4$ which is the same as $W_3$ from $W_r$
    by simply erasing $r-3$ contiguous edges of the central vertex and 
    contracting all those edges that contain vertices that were disconected
    from the central vertex.\pn
    
    As in graph matroids it is the same to take the minor matroid or taking the
    matroid of the minor graph, what we have said is already sufficient.
\end{proof}
