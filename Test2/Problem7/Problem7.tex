    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Show that $T_8$ and $R_8$ ar both self-dual.
        \item Show that $R_8$ is identically self-dual but $T_8$ is not.
        \item Give geometric representation for $T_8$ and $R_8$.
        \item Show that if $M \in \{T_8, R_8\}$ and $X = E(M) \setminus \{8\}$, then
                $(M|X)^* \cong F_7^-$.
        \item Consider the following matrices over $GF(3)$:
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Test2/Problem7/SecondMatrices.png}
            \end{center}\pn
            Show, by applying a sequence of the row and clolumn opeartions to $A_1$ and $A_2$
            that $M[A_1] \cong T_8$ and $M[A_2] \cong R_8$.
        \item Show that $R_8$ can be obtained from $AG(3, 2)$ by relaxing two disjoint 
            circuit-hyperplanes.

\begin{proof}$\,$\pn
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item 
        
            Theorem 2.2.8 from~\cite{Oxley} sates that if a linear matroid is expresed as $[I_n | D]$,
            then its dual matroid can be represented with the matrix $[-D^T | I_r]$.\pn
            
            As multiplying columns by $-1$ doesn't change dependency/independency conditions. The dual matroid can be represented
            as $[D^T | I_r]$.\pn
            
            For both, $T_8$ and $R_8$, we have that $n = 4$, $r = 4$, and $D = D^T$. Then, in both cases, 
            $[D^T | I_r] = [D^T | I_n] = [D | I_n]$. And with this representation is clear how we would build an
            isomorphism from $T_8$ to $T_8^*$ and from $R_8$ to $R_8^*$.
