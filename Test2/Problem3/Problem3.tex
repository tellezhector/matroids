    Let $e$ and $f$ be distinct elements of a matroid. Prove that every circuit containing $e$ also contains $f$ if and only if 
    $\{e\}$ or $\{e, f\}$ is a cocircuit.
}
\begin{proof}
    $\,$\pn
    \textbf{Sufficiency}\pn
        Suppose every circuit containing $e$ also contains $f$.\pn 
        
        If every basis contains $e$, then, no cobasis contains $e$, which means $\{e\}$ is a
        cocircuit.\pn
        
        Suppose then that there is a basis $B$ such that $e \notin B$. As $C(e, B)$ is a circuit that contains $e$, then
        $f \in B$. That is, any basis that doesn't contain $e$, contains $f$. That is, any cobasis that contains $e$, doesn't 
        contain $f$.\pn 
        
        Note that $B \setminus \{f\} \cup \{e\}$ is a basis given that it has the right size to be a basis and
        it is obtained from $B \cup \{e\}$ getting rid of the only circuit that it contains (that is, it is independent). Then, there
        is a basis that doesn't contains $e$ and then $\{e\}$ is coindependent, and there is also a basis that doesn't contain $f$ and then
        $\{f\}$ is also coindependent.\pn
        
        Now suppose there is a basis $B'$ such that $f \notin B'$. If $e \notin B'$, then $C(e, B')$ is a circuit that contains
        $e$ but not $f$ whitch contradicts our hyphothesis. Then any basis that doesn't contain $f$, contains $e$. That is,
        any cobasis containg $f$, doesn't contain $e$.\pn
        
        Then $\{e, f\}$ is a subset that is not contained in any cobasis, then it is codependent but any of its subsets is coindependent.
        Then it is a cocircuit as we wished to show.
        
    \textbf{Necessity}\pn
