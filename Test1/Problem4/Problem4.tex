    Prove that $\B$ is the collection of bases of a matroid on 
    $E$ if and only if $\B$ satisfies (B1) and the following two conditions:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(B2)'] If $B_1, B_2 \in \B$ and $e \in B_1$, then there is an element $f$ of
                        $B_2$ such that $(B_1 \setminus \{e\}) \cup \{f\} \in \B$.
                        
        \item[(B3)] If $B_1, B_2 \in \B$ and $B_1 \subset B_2$, then $B_1 = B_2$.
    \end{itemize}
}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\B$ is the collection of bases of a matroid.
    
    Then, it satisfies (B1) and.
