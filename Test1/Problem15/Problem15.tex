    Let $M$ be a matroid and $\omega: E(M) \rightarrow \R$ be a one-to-one function. 
    Prove that $M$ has a unique basis of maximum weight.
}
\begin{proof}
    Let $B$ be a maximum-weight basis found using greedy. Suppose that there is another basis $B'$ with maximum-weight also and
    suppose that they are different.\pn
    
    Let $e \in B' \setminus B$ of minimum-weight (it exists because $\omega$ is one-to-one), and then, there exists $f \in B \setminus B'$ such that
    $(B' \setminus \{e\}) \cup  \{f\}$ is basis. We can choose such $f$ of maximum weight. If $\omega(e) < \omega(f)$ then we have increased the 
    weight of $B'$, which is a contradiction. If $\omega(f) < \omega(e)$ we can change the roles of $B$ and $B'$ and get the same contradiction.\pn
    
    So, there is no other basis $B'$ with maximum-weight and different from $B$.
