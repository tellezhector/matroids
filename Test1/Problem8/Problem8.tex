    Show that a subset $X$ of a matroid is a basis if and only if $X$ is both independent and spanning.
}
\begin{proof}
    $\,$\pn
    \textbf{Sufficiency}\pn

    If $X$ is a basis of a matroid $M$, then by definition of basis, it is independent. Also, as $X$ is
    basis, then $r(X) = r(X \cup x)$ for any $x \in E(M)$ and, therefore, $cl(X) = E(M)$, that is, $X$ is spanning.\pn
    
    \textbf{Necessity}\pn
    
    Suppose that $X$ is both independent and spanning. As $X$ is spanning, then $r(X) = r(M)$, that is, for any $B \in \B(M)$,  
    $|X| \geq r(X) = r(B) = |B|$. On the other hand, $X \in \I(M)$ so, for any $B \in \B(M)$, $|X| \leq |B|$. We have then that
    $|B| \leq |X| \leq |B|$, that is $|B| = |X|$ for any $\B(M)$ and therefore, $X$ is a basis.
