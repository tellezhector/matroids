    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item   Let $M$ be a matroid. $\B$ its collection of bases and $\I$ its collection
                of independent sets.\pn
                
                $M$ is a paving matroid if and only if for every $A \subset E(M)$ with
                $|A| < r(M)$ there exists $B \in \B$ such that $A \subset B$.\pn
                
                As $M$ is matroid, by $I2$, this is exactly the same as saying:\pn
                
                $M$ is a paving matroid if and only if for every $A \subset E(M)$ with
                $|A| < r(M)$, $A \in \I$.\pn
                
                \begin{proof}
                    If $M$ is paving, by definition of paving matroid, any $A \in E(M)$ such
                    that $|A| < r(M)$ then, $A \in \I$ (and therefore, there is some $B \in \B$
                    such that $A \subset B$).\pn
                    
                    If $M$ is a matroid such that for every $A \subset E(M)$ with
                    $|A| \leq r(M)$ there exists $B \in \B$ such that $A \subset B$ (and 
                    therefore, $A \in \I$). Then, suppose that $C$ is a circuit of $M$. 
                    If $|C| < r(M)$, then there would be some $B \in \B$ such that 
                    $C \subset B$, but then $C \in \I$, which is a contradiction and therefore 
                    $|C| \geq r(M)$. That is, $M$ is paving.\pn
                \end{proof}
                
        \item   A matroid $M$ is uniform if and only if it has no circuits of size less than 
               $r(M) + 1$.
