    Suppose $B$ is a basis of a matroid $M$, $f \in E(M)$ and $e \in E(M) \setminus B$.
    Prove that $(B\cup \{e\}) \setminus \{ f \}$ is a basis of $M$ if and only if $f \in C(e, B)$.

\begin{proof}$\,$\pn
    \textbf{Sufficiency}\pn
    
    Suppose that $f \in C(e, B)$. $C(e, B)$ is the only circuit contained in $B \cup \{e\}$ by definition. Then
    $(B \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{f\}$ does not contain any circuit, that means, it is independent. On the other hand,
    $e \notin B$ and $f \in B$, then $|(B \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{f\}| = (|B| + 1) - 1 = |B|$, therefore,
    $(B \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{f\}$ is a basis, as it is an independent set with the size of a basis.\pn
    
    
    \textbf{Necessity}\pn
    
    We know that $(B \cup \{e\})$ contains only one circuit (and it is $C(e, B)$). If $(B\cup \{e\}) \setminus \{ f \}$ is
    a basis of $M$, then it can not contain $C(e, B)$. That is, $C(e, B) \subseteq (B \cup \{e\})$, but 
    $C(e, B) \not\subseteq (B \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{f\}$, then $f$ must be in $C(e, B)$.\pn
